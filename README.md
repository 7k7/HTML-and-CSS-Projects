# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Here are some sample websites I made using HTML and CSS.

## Project

- [Space Station Site](https://github.com/7k7/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/space_station_project)
- [Move Theater Site](https://github.com/7k7/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/bootstrap4_project)

### Space Station Site

This web page resembles the home page for a space travel company.
Contains a navbar, image container and a contact form.
I styled it using CSS.

### Movie Theater Site

This web page resembles a home page for a movie theater -- styled with Bootstrap 4.
Many Bootstrap components are found in this web page like a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards
and dropdowns.
