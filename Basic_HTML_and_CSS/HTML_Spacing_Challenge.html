                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lorem&nbsp;Ipsum</span> is simply <em>dummy</em> text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text <span style="font-style: italic;">ever</span> since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                    but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                    <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 
                    <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/50kAAOSwfCpbKOqj/s-l1600.jpg" target="_blank">Letraset sheets</a> containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem&nbsp;Ipsum.
